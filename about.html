      Alexander Iurovetski lives in Melbourne, Australia. He had gone with the wind of freedom from the
      former Soviet camp to the former British colony. Alex codes and debugs for the sake of living, and
      bugs living for the sake of writing. Occasionally, he helps his charming wife to raise their two
      sweetly mischievous boys.
